# using-pytube-to-downlod-videos
 Downloading youtube videos, playlists, search results, and channels using python scripts.

## How it works:

For example:
- if you want to download playlists in 720p, Put URLs in a Url_list in list720.py file, if any video doesn't have the quality you want, it will try to download it in different quality.

- Run list720.py file
